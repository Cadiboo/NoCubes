# Features to add back

- MarchingTetrahedra
- Object pooling for all vectors, faces, caches etc.
	- CornerDensityCache
	- SmoothableCache
	- StateCache (changed to Area, kinda)
- Keybinds to
	- toggle terrain collisions
	- set the extended fluid range
	- set the mesh generator
- Config options to tweak rendering:

	- betterTextures (getTexturePosAndState iteration + search for snow)
	- renderShortGrass
	- smoothFluidLighting
	- smoothFluidColors
	- naturalFluidTextures
- DynamicTreesCompatibility
- Ability to auto-discover smoothables by reflecting world generator classes (not fully implemented)
